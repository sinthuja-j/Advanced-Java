Game Board AI

Overview

The Game Board AI is a Java-based strategy game where a human player competes against an AI opponent on a square grid. The objective is to align k adjacent tiles in a row, column, or diagonal while navigating around unavailable positions on the board. The game ends when a player wins or when the board is full, resulting in a draw.

This project demonstrates key concepts in data structures, algorithms, and artificial intelligence, including:

âœ” Hash Tables with Separate Chaining for efficient game state storage.
âœ” Game State Evaluation to determine the best moves for the AI.
âœ” Dynamic Board Representation using a 2D character grid.

Features

ðŸ”¹ Turn-Based Gameplay â€“ The game alternates between the human player and the AI.
ðŸ”¹ Smart AI Opponent â€“ The AI evaluates board states to determine the best move.
ðŸ”¹ Customizable Board Size â€“ Supports different grid sizes and win conditions.
ðŸ”¹ Efficient Game State Storage â€“ Uses a custom hash table to avoid redundant calculations.
ðŸ”¹ Win & Draw Detection â€“ Automatically checks for game-ending conditions.

How It Works

The board size (R Ã— R) and winning condition (k tiles in a row/column/diagonal) are customizable.
The game state is stored as a string representation, using:
'h' â†’ Human player's tile
'c' â†’ Computer (AI) tile
'e' â†’ Empty tile
'u' â†’ Unavailable tile
The AI evaluates potential moves using a score-based system:
3 â†’ AI wins
0 â†’ Human wins
2 â†’ Draw
1 â†’ Game still in progress
The AI avoids recalculating previous board states by storing them in a custom dictionary (hash table).
Implementation Details
The project consists of three main Java classes:

ðŸŸ¢ 1. Record.java

Stores a game state and its corresponding score and level in the AIâ€™s decision tree.

ðŸ”µ 2. Dictionary.java

Implements a custom hash table with separate chaining to store previously encountered game states.

Collision Handling: Uses linked lists for separate chaining.
Efficient Lookup: Prevents redundant calculations.

ðŸŸ¡ 3. Evaluate.java

Handles game logic, board representation, and AI decision-making.

Detects winning moves for both players.
Stores and retrieves board states from the hash table.
Evaluates the best move for the AI using precomputed game states.
