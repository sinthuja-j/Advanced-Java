🏆 Advanced Java Assignments

Welcome to my Advanced Java repository! 🎯 This repo contains three challenging assignments that showcase my expertise in data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming.

📌 Assignments

🏆 Assignment 1: Game Board 🎲

🔹 Description: Implements a hash table with separate chaining and a game board evaluation system.
🔹 Key Features:

Efficient hash table implementation
Game state evaluation
Optimized searching and storage


🏆 Assignment 2: Object Simulation Game 🕹️

🔹 Description: A simulation game where objects interact dynamically based on predefined rules.
🔹 Key Features:

Event-driven object interactions
Real-time state updates
Modular and scalable design


🏆 Assignment 3: Roadmap Navigation System 🗺️

🔹 Description: Finds the optimal path between two locations using graph traversal algorithms.
🔹 Key Features:

Graph-based pathfinding
Uses DFS with constraints
Supports different road types (public, private, construction)

🚀 Technologies Used

✔️ Java (OOP, Exception Handling, Iterators)
✔️ Data Structures (Hash Tables, Graphs, Stacks, Iterators)
✔️ Algorithms (DFS, Pathfinding, Game State Evaluation)
